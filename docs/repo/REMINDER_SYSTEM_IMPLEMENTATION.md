# Reminder System Implementation

## Overview
This document describes the implementation of the reminder system and the fix for the "Continue" button in abandoned tasks.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Continue Button Not Working for Abandoned Tasks
**Problem**: When clicking "Continue" on an unfinished task, nothing happened.

**Solution**: 
- Added better logging in `ProactiveInsightsManager.ts` to track URL extraction
- Improved error handling in `EventManager.ts` when creating and switching tabs
- Added sessionId to abandoned task insights for potential future enhancements
- The URL is now correctly extracted from `activity.data.url` or `analysis.url`

**Files Modified**:
- `src/main/ProactiveInsightsManager.ts`: Added logging and sessionId to abandoned task insights
- `src/main/EventManager.ts`: Improved error handling and logging for resume_research action

### 2. No Confirmation When Setting Reminder
**Problem**: When clicking "Set Reminder", there was no UI feedback, and no way to view reminders.

**Solution**: Implemented a complete reminder management system with:
- Backend storage for reminders
- Toast notifications for feedback
- Dedicated UI for viewing and managing reminders

## New Features

### Reminder Storage (Backend)

#### UserDataManager
**File**: `src/main/UserDataManager.ts`

Added methods for reminder management:
- `saveReminder(userId, reminder)`: Save a new reminder
- `getReminders(userId)`: Get all reminders for a user
- `updateReminder(userId, reminderId, updates)`: Update a reminder
- `deleteReminder(userId, reminderId)`: Delete a reminder
- `completeReminder(userId, reminderId)`: Mark a reminder as completed

Reminders are stored in: `user-data/{userId}/reminders.json`

#### EventManager
**File**: `src/main/EventManager.ts`

Added IPC handlers:
- `get-reminders`: Fetch all reminders for current user
- `complete-reminder`: Mark a reminder as completed
- `delete-reminder`: Delete a reminder
- `execute-reminder-action`: Execute the action associated with a reminder

Updated `execute-insight-action` handler to:
- Store reminders when actionType is 'remind'
- Send 'reminder-set' event to UI for toast notification

### Reminder API (Preload)

#### sidebar.ts
**File**: `src/preload/sidebar.ts`

Added reminder APIs:
- `getReminders()`: Fetch reminders
- `completeReminder(reminderId)`: Complete a reminder
- `deleteReminder(reminderId)`: Delete a reminder
- `executeReminderAction(reminderId)`: Execute reminder action
- `onReminderSet(callback)`: Listen for reminder-set events
- `removeReminderSetListener()`: Remove listener

#### sidebar.d.ts
**File**: `src/preload/sidebar.d.ts`

Added TypeScript interfaces:
- `Reminder`: Type definition for reminder objects
- Updated `SidebarAPI` interface with reminder methods

### UI Components

#### Toast Component
**File**: `src/renderer/sidebar/src/components/Toast.tsx`

A notification component that:
- Shows success/error/info messages
- Auto-dismisses after 3 seconds (configurable)
- Supports different styles based on message type
- Can be manually dismissed

#### Reminders Component
**File**: `src/renderer/sidebar/src/components/Reminders.tsx`

A dedicated view for managing reminders:
- Lists all active reminders
- Shows/hides completed reminders
- Allows executing reminder actions
- Can mark reminders as complete
- Can delete reminders
- Shows creation date for each reminder

#### SidebarApp Updates
**File**: `src/renderer/sidebar/src/SidebarApp.tsx`

Integrated reminder system:
- Added 'reminders' to view state
- Added toast state management
- Listens for 'reminder-set' events and shows toast
- Renders Toast components
- Renders Reminders component

#### Chat Component Updates
**File**: `src/renderer/sidebar/src/components/Chat.tsx`

Added reminders button:
- New "Reminders" button in header
- Uses Bell icon from lucide-react
- Navigates to reminders view when clicked

## Data Flow

### Setting a Reminder

1. User clicks "Set Reminder" on an insight
2. `InsightsContext.executeAction()` is called
3. IPC call to `execute-insight-action` in main process
4. Main process:
   - Creates reminder object
   - Saves to `UserDataManager`
   - Sends 'reminder-set' event to renderer
5. Renderer:
   - Receives 'reminder-set' event
   - Shows success toast notification

### Viewing Reminders

1. User clicks "Reminders" button in Chat header
2. SidebarApp switches to 'reminders' view
3. Reminders component:
   - Fetches reminders via `getReminders()` IPC call
   - Displays active and completed reminders
   - Provides actions for each reminder

### Executing a Reminder

1. User clicks "Execute" on a reminder
2. `executeReminderAction()` IPC call
3. Main process:
   - Finds the reminder
   - Executes the action (e.g., open URL)
   - Marks reminder as completed
4. UI refreshes to show updated state

## User Experience Improvements

### After
