# Insights System Improvements

## Overview
This document describes the improvements made to the proactive insights system to prevent duplicate processing, track acted-upon insights, and improve user experience.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ Track Activities Used for Insights Generation

**Problem**: Every time insights were generated, the system would reprocess all activities, leading to duplicate insights and wasted processing.

**Solution**: 
- Added `InsightGenerationMetadata` interface to track:
  - Last generation timestamp
  - Last activity timestamp
  - Total insights generated
  - Total insights acted upon
- Filter activities by timestamp to only process new ones
- Persist metadata per user in `insights-metadata.json`

**Files Modified**:
- `src/main/ProactiveInsightsManager.ts`: Added metadata tracking and activity filtering

**Benefits**:
- Faster insight generation (only processes new activities)
- No duplicate insights from old activities
- Better performance for users with large activity history

### 2. ✅ Track Acted-Upon Insights & Prevent Double Actions

**Problem**: Users could execute the same insight multiple times, and there was no way to see which insights had been acted upon.

**Solution**:
- Added `actedUpon` and `actedUponAt` fields to `ProactiveInsight` interface
- Mark insights as acted upon when executed (except reminders)
- Prevent re-execution of acted-upon insights
- Persist all insights (both active and acted upon) to disk
- Show acted-upon insights in a history view with greyed out styling

**Files Modified**:
- `src/main/ProactiveInsightsManager.ts`: Added persistence and marking methods
- `src/main/EventManager.ts`: Check and mark insights as acted upon
- `src/preload/sidebar.d.ts`: Updated type definitions
- `src/renderer/sidebar/src/contexts/InsightsContext.tsx`: Updated interface
- `src/renderer/sidebar/src/components/Insights.tsx`: Added history view

**UI Changes**:
- Header now shows count: "X active, Y in history"
- "Refresh" button replaced with "Show History" toggle
- History section shows greyed-out insights with:
  - Reduced opacity (60%)
  - Check circle icon
  - "Acted upon" date
  - No action buttons

**Benefits**:
- Prevents accidental duplicate actions
- Clear visual feedback on what's been done
- Historical record of insights and when they were acted upon
- Better understanding of past behavior patterns

### 3. ✅ Prevent Duplicate Reminders

**Problem**: Users could set multiple reminders for the same insight, cluttering the reminders list.

**Solution**:
- Check for existing non-completed reminders for the same insight before creating new ones
- Return error if duplicate reminder already exists: "Reminder already set for this insight"
- User gets clear feedback via error alert

**Files Modified**:
- `src/main/EventManager.ts`: Added duplicate check in `execute-insight-action` handler

**Benefits**:
- Cleaner reminders list
- No confusion from duplicate reminders
- Clear error message if user tries to create duplicate

## Technical Implementation Details

### Data Structures

#### InsightGenerationMetadata
```typescript
interface InsightGenerationMetadata {
  userId: string;
  lastGenerationTimestamp: string;  // ISO timestamp
  lastActivityTimestamp: string;    // ISO timestamp
  totalInsightsGenerated: number;
  totalInsightsActedUpon: number;
}
```

Stored in: `user-data/{userId}/insights-metadata.json`

#### ProactiveInsight (Updated)
```typescript
interface ProactiveInsight {
  // ... existing fields ...
  actedUpon?: boolean;
  actedUponAt?: Date;
}
```

Stored in: `user-data/{userId}/insights.json`

### Key Methods Added

#### ProactiveInsightsManager

**loadGenerationMetadata(userId)**
- Loads metadata file for user
- Returns null if doesn't exist (first run)

**saveGenerationMetadata(userId, metadata)**
- Saves metadata to disk
- Creates directory if needed

**loadInsights(userId)**
- Loads all insights (active + acted upon) from disk
- Converts date strings back to Date objects

**saveInsights(userId, insights)**
- Saves all insights to disk
- Overwrites previous file

**markInsightAsActedUpon(userId, insightId)**
- Finds insight by ID
- Sets `actedUpon = true` and `actedUponAt = new Date()`
- Updates cache and saves to disk

### Insight Generation Flow (Updated)

1. **Load metadata** → Get last generation timestamp
2. **Load activities** → Filter by timestamp (only new ones)
3. **Early return** if no new activities → Return existing insights
4. **Process activities** → Enrich, segment, detect patterns
5. **Generate new insights** from patterns
6. **Load existing insights** from disk
7. **Merge insights**:
   - Keep all acted-upon insights (history)
   - Add new insights
8. **Save to disk** → Persist combined insights
9. **Update metadata** → Save new timestamps and counts

### Execution Flow (Updated)

1. **Check if acted upon** → Return error if already acted upon (except reminders)
2. **Execute action**:
   - For workflows: Open URLs → Mark as acted upon
   - For abandoned tasks: Open last URL → Mark as acted upon
   - For reminders: Check for duplicates → Create if unique (NOT marked as acted upon)
3. **Return result** → Success or error message

## UI Improvements

### Before
- All insights shown together
- "Refresh" button (confusing - what does it refresh?)
- No way to see acted-upon insights
- Could execute same insight multiple times

### After
- **Active insights** shown first (can be acted upon)
- **History section** (toggle-able) shows acted-upon insights
- **Show/Hide History** button (clear purpose)
- Acted-upon insights are visually distinct:
  - Greyed out with reduced opacity
  - Check circle icon indicating completion
  - Shows when acted upon
  - No action buttons (read-only)
- Clear feedback: "X active, Y in history" in header

## Data Persistence

### Files Created Per User

```
user-data/{userId}/
├── insights.json                    # All insights (active + acted upon)
├── insights-metadata.json           # Generation tracking metadata
└── reminders.json                   # Reminders (existing)
```

### Migration

For existing users:
- First run will have no metadata file → Processes all activities
- After first run, only new activities are processed
- Old insights (if any) will be overwritten with new structure

## Performance Impact

### Before
- Analyzed ALL activities every time: O(n) where n = total activities
- Increasingly slow as activity history grows
- Lots of duplicate LLM calls for same activities

### After
- Analyzes only NEW activities: O(m) where m = new activities since last run
- Constant performance regardless of total history size
- No duplicate LLM processing

**Example**:
- User has 10,000 activities
- Generates insights → Processes all 10,000
- Browses for a day, gains 100 new activities
- Next generation → Only processes 100 activities (100x faster!)

## Error Handling

### Duplicate Reminder
```
User clicks "Set Reminder" on insight they already have a reminder for
→ Error: "Reminder already set for this insight"
→ Toast notification NOT shown (error alert instead)
```

### Already Acted Upon Insight
```
User tries to execute acted-upon insight
→ Error: "This insight has already been acted upon"
→ Toast notification NOT shown (error alert instead)
→ Visible in UI because button would be disabled anyway
```

### No New Activities
```
User clicks "Analyze Behavior" with no new activities
→ Returns existing insights from disk
→ No error, just logs: "No new activities to analyze"
```

## Testing Guide

### Test Activity Tracking
1. Generate insights → Note timestamp in metadata file
2. Browse for a while (create new activities)
3. Generate insights again → Should only process new activities
4. Check logs for "X new activities out of Y total"

### Test Acted-Upon Tracking
1. Generate insights
2. Execute an insight (e.g., "Continue" on abandoned task)
3. Check insights.json → Should have `actedUpon: true`
4. Try executing same insight again → Should get error
5. Click "Show History" → Should see it greyed out

### Test Duplicate Reminders
1. Generate insights with a habit pattern
2. Click "Set Reminder" → Success
3. Click "Set Reminder" again → Should get error
4. Check reminders.json → Only one reminder exists
5. Complete reminder → Can now set another one

### Test History View
1. Generate multiple insights
2. Execute some of them
3. Click "Show History" → Should see:
   - Active insights at top (normal styling)
   - History section below (greyed out)
   - Check circle on acted-upon insights
   - "Acted upon" date on each
4. Execute more → History grows

## Future Enhancements

Possible improvements:
1. **Archive old acted-upon insights** after X days to keep file size manageable
2. **Stats dashboard** showing:
   - Insights generated over time
   - Action rate (% acted upon)
   - Most common insight types
3. **Smart regeneration** based on activity patterns (e.g., auto-run daily)
4. **Undo acted-upon** for cases where user wants to re-execute
5. **Export history** for analysis or backup

## Breaking Changes

None - this is backward compatible. Existing users will:
- Have all activities processed on first run (as before)
- Get new metadata file created
- Lose any existing insights (they'll be regenerated with new structure)
- See improved performance on subsequent runs
